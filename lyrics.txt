My feet are hurtin' mighty bad
Now I've been walkin' for three days
And two lonely nights
You know that I'm mighty bad
But I got a girl waitin' for me
That's gonna make this trip worthwhile
You see, she's got the kind
Of lovin' and kissin'
Make a boy go stone wild
I got to keep on walkin'
Oh I got to walk on
Let me tell you, y'all
I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride
I got fifteen miles to go now
And I can hear my baby callin' my name
It's as if, as though
I'm standin' at her front door
And I can hear that doggone thing
Now I'll be so glad to see my baby
And hold her in my arms one more time
And when I kiss her lips
I turn backward flip
And I forget about these feet of mine

But I just can't lose my stride
Yeah I got to walk on
Let me tell you, y'all
Hope my feet don't fail me now
I got five more miles to go
I got nine, eight, seven
Six, oh six
I got five more miles to go now
Over the hills just around the bend
Although my feet are tired
I can't lose my stride
I got to get my baby back again
I got to keep on walkin'
I got to walk on
Let me tell y'all
I'm so tired now
But I just can't lose my stride
Oh, I got to walk on
Let me tell you now
I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride

Hi, baby. Thank you to the Grammy voters for the incredible honor. Thank you to everyone who worked so hard to beautifully capture the profundity of deep southern culture. I thank god for my family, my wonderful husband, my beautiful daughter my fans for bringing me so much happiness and support. We all experience pain and loss, and often we become inaudible. My intention for the film and album was to create a body of work that would give a voice to our pain, our struggles, our darkness and our history. To confront issues that make us uncomfortable. It's important to show images to my children to reflect their beauty, so they can grow up in a world where they look in the mirror, first at their own families, as well as the news, the Super Bowl, the Olympics, the white house and the Grammy's and see themselves and have no doubt that they're beautiful, intelligent and capable. This is something I want for every child of every race, and I feel its vital that we learn from the past and recognize our tendencies to repeat our mistakes. Thank you again for honoring Lemonade. Have a beautiful evening. Thank you for tonight, this is incredibleYou might also likeEmbed

She got that Sake, her Yamazaki straight from Tokyo
Oh baby, you know, she got them commas and them decimals
She don't gotta give it up 'cause she professional
Six inch heels, she walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn (Goddamn, babe)
She murdered everybody and I was her witness (Oh)
She works for the money (Work for the)
She work for the money (Work for the)
From the start to the finish (Oh baby)
And she worth every dollar (Worth every)
She worth every dollar (Work for the)
And she worth every minute
Stars in her eyes
She fights for the power, keeping time
She grinds day and night
She grinds from Monday to Friday
Work from Friday to Sunday, oh
She gon' slang
She too smart to crave material things
She pushing herself day and night
She grinds from Monday to Friday
Work from Friday to Sunday, oh
Stars in her eyes
She fights and she sweats those sleepless nights
But she don't mind, she loves the grind
She grinds from Monday to Friday
Works from Friday to Sunday, yeah, yeah
She gon' slang
Too smart to crave material things
Stacking her paper, stacking her cake up
She grinds from Monday to Friday
Works from Friday to Sunday
Six inch heels, she walked in the club like nobody's business
Goddamn, she murdered everybody and I was her witness
She works for the money, she work for the money
(Know just what to do to make you love me)
From the start to the finish
And she worth every dollar, she worth every dollar (Love me)
And she worth every minute
Ooh, boy, I'll make you feel
You'll always come back to me
Come back, come back
Come back, come back
Come back, come back
